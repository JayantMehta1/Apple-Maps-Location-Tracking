# Biometrics-Bicycle-Lock-Location-Updates

In addition to the C++ Arduino code for my biometrics bicycle lock project, I followed a Swift tutorial by Electronic Armory on how to get user locations and recieve notifications on location updates.

The idea behind this is to recieve notifications when the location of a user's bicycle changes when they have put it in "parked" mode. Updating the user about their bicycle lock location will help them track where the bicycle is. 

More importantly, it adds value to the fingerprint sensor security system with a notification system.

An iOS location device would be embedded into the bicycle lock system and a cellular plan (similar to Apple Watches) can be purchased at low cost to utilize this bonus service.
